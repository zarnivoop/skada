# Skada

Skada is a modular damage meter with various viewing modes, segmented fights and
customizable windows. It aims to be highly efficient with memory and CPU.

"Skada" is Swedish for "Damage".

**Note:** I had a tiny break, a decade, but recently started playing Season of Discovery, and decided to see if I could make this old addon of mine work again. It may not work correctly yet.**

## Usage

When you first start using Skada, there will be a window created by default.
This window can be extensively customized in Skada's configuration panel; click
the little cog icon to access a menu, and then click _Configure_. Depending on
your user interface, there may also be a minimap button allowing quick access to
this menu.

Skada supports multiple windows. To create a new window, click _Windows_ in the
addon's configuration panel. There are three built-in types of windows - Bar,
Inline, and Data text. _Bar_ is the classic damage meter window, and is very
customizable. _Inline_ shows the meter in a horizontal line, which can be useful
for integration in custom user interfaces. _Data text_ shows just one item at a
time, and can also be displayed by any LDB display addon, such as Titan Panel,
ChocolateBar, or ElvUI.

In the normal Bar window, you can left click on specific items for more detailed
information, and right click for less details. At the very "top" is the list of
all saved fight segments. Some data modes have several detailed information views.
In this case you choose alternate views by holding certain keys pressed while
clicking. For example, in Damage mode, you can Shift-click a player to see what
enemies the player caused damage to. Tooltips will display how to reach the
different views.

You can also use window buttons for selecting fight segment and mode directly.

Scrolling in Skada is done with the mousewheel.

## Plugins

Skada is easy to extend, and there were once many extra plugin addons out there
that add functionality. However, with the addon having been dormant for many years, 
there are likely no working ones out there as of now.

There is a page with [API information here](https://www.wowace.com/projects/skada/pages/API).
